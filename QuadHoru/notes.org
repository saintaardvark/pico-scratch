* What I see
- as I stick pins into ground, numbers start scrolling
  - video recorded.
- this makes sense: the code puts the pins into pull up mode.

* NOW I GET THIS!
- This is based on original_post_corrected_probably_use_this_one.py
  - Each time the timer fires, there are two values that get pushed
    onto fifo: one indicating the state of the two wires, and one
    indicating how many cycles since the last time it was when a
    signal was received.
  - The value of y gets decremented; since it was set to 3, that allows
    for 4 pairs of 32-bit words to go into the FIFO.
  - Once y is 0, we set the interrupt and block until itâ€™s serviced.
    After it is, SM4 goes back to the wait target.
  - the interrupt handler prints the data, along with how long in ms
    it's been since the last time the interrupt fired.
    - That data includes how many times x was decremented.  That * 2
      == number of clock ticks between label "counter_start" and
      x_dec.
